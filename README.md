### Requirements
All experiments were conducted with the following packages:
- numpy==1.19.5
- torch==1.9.0
- torchvision==0.10.0
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- scikit-image==0.17.2

The reference images for the oversampled case dicussed in Hyder et al. [1] were obtained from the [official repository](https://github.com/CSIPlab/learn-reference-pr).
